// Authors: Sabrina and Megan Jenckes
// Date: March 8th, 2024
//
// Purpose: HW-03 building, compiling, and running information
//
// IDE and Programming Language we used:
// Python 3.12.1, Visual Studio Code version 1.87.1 February 2024
//
// Dependencies: Must have the iris.data file on your desktop 
// We have provided the iris.data file in the zipped folder
// so that you can drag it straight to the desktop. 
// The sigmoid.py will also need to be in the same folder as the _main_.py since it
// is imported. (unzipping the folder and opening it in VScode should take care of this) 
//
// Must have Python, Pylance and or the Python Debugger packs installed within Visual 
// Studio Code. 
// Must have Python 3.12.1 installed on the computer you will be using to run the code.
// The Numpy, SciPy, and SkLearn library will also need to be installed, including pip.
// Pip Version: Pip 24.0
// Numpy Version: Numpy 1.26.3
// SciPy Version: SciPy 1.12.0
// SkLearn Version: SkLearn or scikit-learn 1.4.0
//
// Building:
// Using the zipped folder, you can unzip the folder and open folder in Visual Studio Code.
// We have provided the iris.data file as mentioned above.
// You can drag this iris.data file to your desktop. Please ensure that the pathing 
// for the iris.data file on your desktop is STRICTLY like this: C:\Users\user_name\Desktop
//
// Running the program:
// Within Visual Studio Code there are many ways to run the .py file.
// You can go under "Run" at the top of Visual Studio Code and click 
// "Run Without Debugging."
// You can right click within the file in Visual Studio Code and go under
// "Run Python" and then click "Run Python File in Terminal."
// You then can click the down arrow by the play button and click either
// "Run Python File" or "Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal."
// Any of these options should be able to run the _main_.py file
// as long as Python 3.12.1 is installed on the computer.
//
// When the program does run, the final optimal theta values, the confusion matrix,
// and the accuracy and precision will be printed onto the screen in the terminal.
