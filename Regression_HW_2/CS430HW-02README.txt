// TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
// PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
// B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
// LSTAT    % lower status of the population
// MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
// '''
// We have provided a boston.txt file with this change made in the zipped folder
// so that you can drag it straight to the desktop.
//
// Must have Python, Pylance and or the Python Debugger packs installed within Visual 
// Studio Code. 
// Must have Python 3.12.1 installed on the computer you will be using to run the code.
// The Numpy library will also need to be installed, including pip.
// Pip Version: Pip 24.0
// Numpy Version: Numpy 1.26.4
//
// Building:
// Using the zipped folder, you can unzip the folder and open folder in Visual Studio Code.
// We have provided a modified boston.txt file that removed the header information as mentioned
// above.
// You can drag this boston.txt file to your desktop. Please ensure that the pathing 
// for the boston.txt file on your desktop is STRICTLY like this: C:\Users\user_name\Desktop
//
// Running the program:
// Within Visual Studio Code there are many ways to run the .py file.
// You can go under "Run" at the top of Visual Studio Code and click 
// "Run Without Debugging."
// You can right click within the file in Visual Studio Code and go under
// "Run Python" and then click "Run Python File in Terminal."
// You then can click the down arrow by the play button and click either
// "Run Python File" or "Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal."
// Any of these options should be able to run the __main__.py file
// as long as Python 3.12.1 is installed on the computer.
//
// When the program does run, the final theta values and the mean squared errors
// should appear on your desktop in a output.txt file.
